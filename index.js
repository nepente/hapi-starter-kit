This require will validate if your environment is properly configured
If you need to access environment variables DON'T use process.env.MYVAR, instead
require env.js and assign it to some variable ( const env = require('./env'); )
or if you prefer just use destructuring ( const { MYVAR } = require('./env'); ).
